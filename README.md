Simple WP Plugin to connect with metalpriceapi (needs plugin and api key) and show a form to "block price".

The form is a jquery Ajax form that sends data to the db and uses wp-mail() function to send two e-mails, one to the store owner and one to the customer with his blocked price for the metal (gold and silver)

It also does so with gold coins.

Has a backend CPT viewer to show a table with all the recent requests for gold, silver and coins.

Only italian.
